A member of the brassica family,
which includes broccoli, brussels sprouts,
cabbage and kale, cauliflower is pretty much always available,
with stunning consistency in quality all year long.

But farmers' market shoppers may notice them start to show up
in early fall and last until early winter.

Cauliflower heads at commercial grocery stores
look fairly identical, often weighing about 1 to 2 pounds with a uniform,
ivory color, and almost always wrapped in plastic.

But once you break out into smaller specialty groceries and farmers' markets,
size, shape and color can vary drastically - don't be afraid! Orangey-yellow
(or "Cheddar" cauliflower for its color, and not, unfortunately,
because it tastes like cheese), purple and neon green specimens
taste almost the same as the white ones and can be used interchangeably.
